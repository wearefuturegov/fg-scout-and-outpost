_7 September - 21 September_

With our back-end developer on leave, we prioritised the design system. With the help of a product designer from the Royal Borough of Greenwich team we set to work on the design system.

We also created (and populated) this github wiki, not just a place to share these sprintnotes, but as a place to share all documentation, guidance and thinking as we make Outpost easier to reuse.

- We started looking at how to upgrade Outpost to rails 7
- We looked into our Open Referral UK Compliancy
- Began putting together an [[Outpost design system]], using storybook we have a [monorepo](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost-design-system) setup ready to be populated
- Documented all of the current scout components in figma, ready to be standardised with our design tokens approach to the [[Outpost design system]].
