_22 September - 5 October_

This sprint theme is a continuation of the previous sprint but with more back-end input. We have created the [[Outpost design system]] which corresponds to some of the earlier work from sprint 1 and 2 spikes around the design system and how it could fit in with the approach for creating a reusable Outpost. We now need to discuss this approach and decide if its the one we really want to take.

We are also preparing for our first Show and Tell on the reusable outpost and will be having a session this sprint to prioritise our goals as we merge with the Greenwich product team in the next two weeks.

- We have fixed our Open Referral UK compliancy issues
- Deployed changes around pagination on scout
