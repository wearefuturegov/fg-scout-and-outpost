In this show and tell we did a recap of the past year and refreshed everyones memories of what we're trying to solve!

I also spoke about Outpost and the [Outpost Platform](/docs/the-outpost-platform) and gave a demo, you can view just the [demo video](https://youtu.be/Rj1pik62dFM) here. (Apologies for the audio quality, my office had no furniture that week, or the next for that matter)

We also talked about our progress on the Greenwich community directory, combining LocalGov Drupal and Outpost.

Outpost (by design) has no content management features built in. So far we've only used Outpost with a static site generator which uses a seamless approach of jumping between two different sites (scout + cms) with the same design. One of our aims is to expand the Outpost Platform offering and provide some tools to help integrate Outpost into other technologies. This work is the first step towards hopefully being able to share a reusable solution or guidance for displaying services in LocalGov Drupal.

We also spoke about our plans for the future, where we're at with our goals and the [current roadmap](/docs/the-project/roadmap)!

We had some excellent feedback and questions, some of which I have incorporated in the [documentation](/docs). You can view some of the questions on the [Frequently asked questions](docs/the-outpost-platform/getting-started/faq). There were some that were very specific to products so I have added those to some new product faq pages. [Scout FAQ](/docs/scout/faq) and [Outpost FAQ](http://localhost:3000/docs/outpost/faq).

**Outpost Community Meetup**

Our first community meetup! ðŸŽ‰

Topics covered included introductions, and some initial getting to know one another. We spoke about the challenges people are facing and discussed what people would like to get out of the community. We also briefly reviewed the [current roadmap](/docs/the-project/roadmap) that Alex and I put together.
