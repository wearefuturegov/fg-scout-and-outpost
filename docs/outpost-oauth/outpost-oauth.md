# Outpost oAuth

:::caution

This is a stub, [Outpost oAuth](outpost/features/outpost-oauth) is part of [Outpost](outpost). [View the documentation here](outpost/features/outpost-oauth)

:::

Outpost has the ability to allow users to authenticate through its interface meaning you can add other applications on top of outpost.

This means that even though Outpost only manages services it can be combined with other applications to create a completely bespoke application to suit your needs.

For more information see [Outpost oAuth](outpost/features/outpost-oauth)
