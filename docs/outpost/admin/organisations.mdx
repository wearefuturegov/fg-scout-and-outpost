In Outpost every user belongs to an organisation. This makes things simpler!

- A user can belong to one organisation only
- An organisation can have as many services assigned to it as needed
- A service can only belong to one organisation
- An organisation can have multiple users

Each user in the organisation will have their own username and password.

- Users will need to be added to an organisation by an administrator.
- Organsation name is optional, if its not applicable the user can choose to skip the name and it will become known as `Unnamed <organisation_id>` in Outpost.
