# Outpost oAuth

Outpost has the ability to allow users to authenticate through its interface meaning you can add other applications on top of outpost.

This means that even though Outpost only manages services it can be combined with other applications with the same styles, through the design system and other tools available, to create a completely bespoke application to suit your needs.

For example.

You install Outpost, several scouts and some other applications. You wish to create a reporting tool as well, you can do this by creating a separate application and click a login via Outpost button.

One of our [milestones](../../the-project/milestones) is to provide the tools to create a series of boilerplate applications to do just this
