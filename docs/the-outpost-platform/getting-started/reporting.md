# Reporting

This comes up a lot so we're mentioning it up front. The Outpost Platform does not currently contain advanced reporting tools. We provide basic statistics for services.

You can use [Outpost oAuth](../../outpost-oauth) to create an application that uses your existing Outpost logins to create bespoke reports. Another option is [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) an open source java application used for running reports.

We do plan to offer some basic tools but in the meantime our focus is on developing the platform and integrations.
