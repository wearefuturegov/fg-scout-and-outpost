Outpost solves the issue of data duplication within an organisation [[Decoupling data]], but it doesn't yet solve the issue where multiple Outposts sit along shared boundaries.

The goal is to have a way for Outpost to share its data with others. this could be a model similar to IIIF or activityPub in the fediverse or even RSS.
