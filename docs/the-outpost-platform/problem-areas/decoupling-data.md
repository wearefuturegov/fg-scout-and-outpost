# Decoupling data

One of the goals of Outpost is to decouple the data. You can read more about the origin of the problems we're trying to solve in the [Background information](../../the-outpost-platform) page.

One Outpost installation can power unlimited directories on any topic or theme. Simply by changing the parameters sent to the Outpost API we can create a directory of services purely run by people called "Joe".

We could create another that only shows services updated on the 10th of each month. All of the information stays in one place but we are able to present it to meet the needs of real users. This eliminates the need for people to search for their own categories and they can go straight to finding the information that is relevant to them.

> Decoupled, or decoupling, is a state of an IT environment in which two or more systems somehow work or are connected without being directly connected.
> In a decoupled [microservices architecture](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32503/microservices), for example, software services have none or very little knowledge about the other services. In theory, this means that a change can be made to one service without the developer having to worry about how the change will impact other services -- as long as the service's application programming interface ([API](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24407/application-programming-interface-api)) remains the same.
> A decoupled architecture allows software development teams to build, execute, test and debug application modules independently. This approach also allows each module to be developed and maintained by a different team of software developers.
