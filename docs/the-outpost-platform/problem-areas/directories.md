# Directories

The Problem:

> Outpost doesn't need to know about its directories, but individual teams do need to be able to access information thats relevant to them

Creating more than one directory from Outpost presented us with a UX decision. How do we represent the data that is visible between both teams and unique to each in the Outpost interface.

The solution we came up with was directories, this is a check box designed to assign each service to a team and a user interface to view both or individual teams information
